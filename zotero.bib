	abstract = {Since publication of the first edition in 1973, this professional and scientific reference has become the standard work in the field, providing detailed analysis of the state of the art in room acoustics.

It outlines the theory and practice of sound behaviour in enclosed spaces. Particular emphasis is given to the properties and calculation of reverberation, the most obvious acoustical feature of a closed room. Further key topics include the mechanisms of sound absorption and psychoacoustical factors, from which design parameters and figures of merit are derived. Two chapters are devoted to practical questions such as measurement techniques and the procedures of room acoustical design. The interaction between a room's acoustic properties and its electroacoustic systems is also considered, and refined systems for optimizing listening conditions in a room are presented.

This edition includes a new list of symbols, and updated sections include the measurement of the impulse response including a discussion of distortions, sound propagation as a diffusive process and scattering by wall irregularities.},

	abstract = {As well as being able to reproduce sound in one region of space, it would be useful to reduce the level of reproduced sound in other spatial regions, with a “personal audio” system. For mobile devices this is motivated by issues of privacy for the user and the need to reduce annoyance for other people nearby. Such personal audio systems can be realized with arrays of loudspeakers that become superdirectional at low frequencies, when the array dimensions are small compared with the acoustic wavelength. The design of the array then becomes a compromise between performance and array effort, defined as the sum of mean squared driving signals. Various methods of formulating this tradeoff as a regularization problem have been suggested and the connection between these formulations is discussed. Large array efforts are due to strongly self-cancelling multipole arrays. A concern is then the robustness of such an array to variations in the acoustic environment and driver sensitivity and position. The design of an array that is robust to these uncertainties then leads to a generalization of regularization.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7471698},
	abstract = {Sound zones are two or more regions within a listening space where listeners are provided with personal audio. Acoustic contrast control (ACC) is a sound zoning method that maximizes the average squared sound pressure in one zone constrained to constant pressure in other zones. State-of-the-art time domain broadband acoustic contrast control (BACC) methods are designed for anechoic environments. These methods are not able to realize a flat frequency response in a limited frequency range within a reverberant environment. Sound field control in a limited frequency range is a requirement to accommodate the effective working range of the loudspeakers. In this paper, a new BACC method is proposed which results in an implementation realizing a flat frequency response in the target zone. This method is applied in a bandlimited low-frequency scenario where the loudspeaker layout surrounds two controlled zones. The performance is verified with experimental results in an acoustically damped room.},
